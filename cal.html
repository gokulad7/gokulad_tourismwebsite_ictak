        Kozhikode is a coastal city in the south Indian state of Kerala. It was a significant spice trade center and is close to Kappad Beach, where Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama landed in 1498. The central Kozhikode Beach, overlooked by an old lighthouse, is a popular spot for watching the sunset. Inland, tree-lined Mananchira Square, with its musical fountain, surrounds the massive Mananchira Tank, an artificial pond.</p>

               Backwaters </h5>
              <p class="card-text"> Located on the northern side of the scenic state of Kerala, Kozhikode has always been a popular destination for its backwaters. These backwaters are a distinctive feature of this area and have been generously blessed with abundant natural beauty, dense greenery and exotic flora and fauna. The palm-fringed rivulets, lakes and canals of Kozhikode are decked with engaging beauty. The calm of these undisturbed waters is contagious and instils within you a feeling of tranquil peace and serenity. 

                Unlike most rivers that flow towards the direction of the seas and oceans, backwaters are a part of the river that has little or no current. So, boating in the backwaters allows you to move against the natural current! Here at Kozhikode, Canoli River and Kallai River are blessed with these wondrous backwater streams, and they provide a great opportunity to explore the scenic landscapes of this town.</p>
